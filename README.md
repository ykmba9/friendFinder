# friendFinder 
This is a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users, and then the app will display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. 
Express is used here to handle routing.
